  abstract = {Optimization time integrators have proven to be effective at solving complex multi-physics problems, such as deformation of solids with non-linear material models, contact with friction, strain limiting, etc. For challenging problems with high accuracy requirements, Newton-type optimizers are often used. This necessitates first- and second-order derivatives of the global non-linear objective function. Manually differentiating, implementing and optimizing the resulting code is extremely time-consuming, error-prone, and precludes quick changes to the model. We present SymX, a framework based on symbolic expressions that computes the first and second derivatives by symbolic differentiation, generates efficient vectorized source code, compiles it on-the-fly, and performs the global assembly of element contributions in parallel. The user only has to provide the symbolic expression of an energy function for a single element in the discretization and our system will determine the assembled derivatives for the whole model. SymX is designed to be an integral part of a simulation system and can easily be integrated into existing ones. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework in various complex simulations showing different non-linear materials, higher-order finite elements, rigid body systems, adaptive cloth, frictional contact, and coupling multiple interacting physical systems. Moreover, we compare our method with alternative approaches and show that SymX is significantly faster than a current state-or-the-art framework (up to two orders of magnitude for a higher-order FEM simulation).},

  abstract = {An efficient finite element (FE) formulation for the simulation of multibody systems is derived from Hamilton's principle. According to the classical assumptions of multibody systems, a large rotation formulation has been chosen, where large rotations and large displacements, but only small deformations of the single bodies are taken into account. Absolute coordinates are chosen for the degrees of freedom. The numerical solution strategy is based on the assumption that the period of large rotations of the single bodies is much larger than the period of oscillations due to deformation. The strain tensor is modified based on the latter assumption and therefore, the present formulation distinguishes significantly from standard nodal based nonlinear finite element methods. Constraints are defined in integral form for every pair of surfaces of two bodies. This leads to a small number of constraint equations and avoids artificial stress singularities. Due to the special structure of the resulting system, the most expensive part of the system of equations can be solved in advance and only once for a given Runge-Kutta scheme. The present method has been implemented and tested with the FE-package NETGEN/NGSOLVE.},

The DDMbased response sensitivity results are compared with corresponding forward finite difference analysis results, thus validating the formulation presented and its computer implementation. The developments presented in this paper close an important gap between FE responseonly analysis and FE response sensitivity analysis through the DDM, extending the latter to applications requiring response sensitivities of FE models with MPCs.

The aim is to minimize the information exchange across the different platforms yet still obtain results of engineering accuracy. Many approaches for solving flexible multibody systems consisting of elastic and rigid components have focused on how the equations of motion for the flexible components can be formulated and combined with other component equations. We present a Partitioned Iteration Method (PIM), which can decouple the elastic deformation and rigid body motion of the flexible body by employing a CGfollowing floating reference frame. In the PIM, the global motion of a flexible body is expressed as a summation of the linearized elastic deformation measured in the CG-following reference frame and the motion of the reference frame and be solved in separated finite element and multibody dynamics solvers. The PIM is combined with the gluing algorithm and is used to solve multiple flexible bodies in a distributed simulation environment. It enables the use of independent simulation servers, where each server can run commercially available or research-based MBD and/or FE solvers. Examples are provided to demonstrate the performance of the new method and to show how to decouple and integrate a general flexible multi-body dynamics system.},

The paper discusses future research directions for using ANCF finite elements in new areas such as soft tissues and materials relevant to broader areas of computational engineering and science. Selection of coordinates, definitions of forces and moments, geometric interpretation of the position gradients, and noncommutativity of finite rotations are among the topics discussed. To address concerns associated with finite-rotation noncommutativity and definition of moments in flexible-body dynamics, the paper demonstrates that the interpolation order is not preserved when the finite-rotation sequence is changed. Position gradients, on the other hand, are unique and preserve the highest interpolation order. It is shown that, while the spin tensor used to define the ANCF generalized forces due to moment application is associated with a rigid frame defined by the polar decomposition theorem, explicit polar decomposition of the matrix of position-gradient vectors is not required. ANCF elements have features that distinguish them from conventional finite elements and make them suited for largedisplacement analysis of multibody systems (MBS). Their displacement fields, which allow increasing interpolation order without increasing number of nodes or using noncommutative finite rotations, are the basis for developing lower-dimension consistent rotation-based formulations (CRBF) without lowering the interpolation order. Nonetheless, the continuumkinematic description of fully parameterized ANCF elements cannot be ignored when interpreting the ANCF numerical results. This issue is particularly important when comparing ANCF results with solutions obtained using semi-continuum conventional beam and plate models and simplified analytical approaches.},

The dynamic analysis of flexible MBS is based on a nonlinear finite element formulation. The first method is a weakly coupled method, which reformulates the dynamic response optimization problem in a two-level approach. First, a rigid or flexible MBS simulation is performed, and second, each component is optimized independently using a quasi-static approach in which a series of equivalent static load (ESL) cases obtained from the MBS simulation are applied to the respective components. The second method, the fully coupled method, performs the dynamic response optimization using the time response obtained directly from the flexible MBS simulation. Here, an original procedure is proposed to evaluate the ESL from a nonlinear finite element simulation, contrasting with the floating reference frame formulation exploited in the standard ESL method. Several numerical examples are provided to support our position. It is shown that the fully coupled method is more general and accommodates all types of constraints at the price of a more complex optimization process.},

They allow well-established and specialized simulation tools for different fields and signals to be combined and reused with minor adaptations in contrast to the monolithic approach. However, the partitioned treatment of the coupled system poses the drawback of stability and accuracy challenges. If several different subsystems are used to form the co-simulation scenario, these issues are especially important. In this work, we propose a new co-simulation algorithm based on interface Jacobians. It allows for the stable and accurate solution of complex co-simulation scenarios involving several different subsystems. Furthermore, the Interface Jacobian-based Co-Simulation Algorithm is formulated such that it enables parallel execution of the participating subsystems. This results in a high-efficient procedure. Furthermore, the Interface Jacobian-based Co-Simulation Algorithm handles algebraic loops as the co-simulation scenario is defined in residual form.

  abstract = {The Floating Frame of Reference Formulation (FFRF) is one of the most widely used methods to analyze flexible multibody systems subjected to large rigid-body motion but small strains and deformations. The FFRF is conventionally derived via a continuum mechanics approach. This tedious and circuitous approach, which still attracts attention among researchers, yields so-called inertia shape integrals. These unhandy volume integrals, arising in the FFRF mass matrix and quadratic velocity vector, depend not only on the degrees of freedom, but also on the finite element shape functions. That is why conventional computer implementations of the FFRF are laborious and error prone; they require access to the algorithmic level of the underlying finite element code or are restricted to a lumped mass approximation. This contribution presents a nodal-based treatment of the FFRF to bypass these integrals. Each flexible body is considered in its spatially discretized state ab initio, wherefore the integrals are replaced by multiplications by a constant finite element mass matrix. Besides that, this approach leads to a simpler and concise but rigorous derivation of the equations of motion. The steps to obtain the inertia-integral-free equations of motion (in 2D and 3D spaces) are presented in a clear and comprehensive way; the final result provides ready-to-implement equations of motion without a lumped mass approximation, in contrast to the conventional formulation.},

Special emphasis is laid on converged solutions and on a comparison to analytical and numerical solutions from the literature. In addition to the work of previous authors, the computational performance of both formulations is studied for the dynamic case, where detailed information is provided, concerning the different effects influencing the single parts of the computation time. In case of the ANCF finite element, a planar formulation based on the Bernoulli--Euler theory is utilized, consisting of two position and two slope coordinates in each node only. In the FFRF beam finite element, the displacements are described by the rigid body motion and a small superimposed transverse deflection. The latter is described by means of two static modes for the rotation at the boundary and a user-defined number of eigenmodes of the clamped-clamped beam. In numerical studies, the accuracy and computational costs of the two formulations are compared for a cantilever beam, a pendulum, and a slider-crank mechanism. It turns out that both formulations have comparable performance and that the choice of the optimal formulation depends on the problem configuration. Recent claims in literature that the ANCF would have deficiencies compared with the FFRF thus can be refuted.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an overview of research and development efforts that are currently being devoted to integrate large deformation finite element formulations with flexible multibody system algorithms. The goal is to develop computer simulation capabilities for the analysis of physics and engineering models with significant details. The successful development of such new and integrated algorithms will also allow modeling and simulation of systems that cannot be solved using existing computer algorithms and codes. One of the main difficulties encountered in this integration process is attributed to the fact that the solution procedures used in finite element codes differ significantly from those used in general-purpose flexible multibody system codes. Finite element methods employ the corotational formulations that are often used with incremental solution procedures. Flexible multibody computer codes, on the other hand, do not, in general, use incremental solution procedures. Three approaches are currently being explored by academic institutions and the software industry. In the first approach, gluing algorithms that aim at performing successful simulations by establishing an interface between existing codes are used. Using different coordinates and synchronizing the time stepping are among several challenging problems that are encountered when gluing algorithms are used. In the second approach, multibody system capabilities are implemented in existing finite element algorithms that are based on large rotation vector formulations. For the most part, corotational formulations and incremental solution procedures are used in this case. In the third approach, a new large deformation finite element formulation that can be successfully implemented in flexible multibody system computer algorithms that employ nonincremental solution procedures is introduced. The approach that is now being developed in several institutions is based on the finite element absolute nodal coordinate formulation. Such a formulation can be systematically implemented in general-purpose flexible multibody system computer algorithms. Nonlinear constraint equations that describe mechanical joints between different bodies can be formulated in terms of the absolute coordinates in a straightforward manner. The coupling between the motion of rigid, flexible, and very flexible bodies can also be accurately described. The successful integration of large deformation finite element and multibody system algorithms will lead to a new generation of computer codes that can be systematical and efficiently used in the analysis of many engineering applications.},
