== Conclusion
In this work the explicit methods of weak coupling were tested The quasi-dynamic coupling converged with un-satisfactory results whereas the fully dynamic coupling did not converge. The reasons of which are discussed in the previous section. 

== Outlook  
Co-simulation is a great tool as it eases the computational effort by dividing the physical phenomena to be simulated with its own code rather than devising a new approach to simulate the natural phenomena together from ground up. 
In case of the RBD-FEA coupling or flexible body dynamics @shabanaIntegrationLargeDeformation2007a have already shown that the traditional co-simulation methods have already reached their limits. A better option is to use
